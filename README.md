This repository contains projects demonstrating conversation management and JSON schema-based information extraction using Groq API (OpenAI-compatible). It also includes a Streamlit web app for interactive chat.

üìÇ Version 1: Without LangChain
Features / Tasks

Task 1: Conversation Management & Summarization

Maintains conversation history per session.

Summarizes conversation every k-th turn using Groq API.

Handles multiple users via session_id.

Task 2: JSON Schema Classification & Information Extraction

Extracts structured information (name, email, phone, location, age) from user messages.

Returns missing fields as null.

Web App (Streamlit)

Interactive chat interface.

Dynamically extracts JSON if user mentions json or extract.

Shows collapsible conversation track and full conversation history.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Features / Tasks

Task 1: Conversation Management & Summarization (LangChain)

Uses ConversationSummaryMemory to summarize conversations.

Uses RunnableWithMessageHistory for session-based history.

Supports window memory (ConversationBufferWindowMemory) for last k turns.

Summarization after every k-th turn.

Task 2: JSON Schema Classification & Extraction (LangChain)
